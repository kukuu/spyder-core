# SPYDER

https://www.energytariffscheck.com/ 

SPYDER is an AI-driven platform for the energy sector. It was designed to ingest, process, and make sense of complex energy tariff data to provide actionable insights - a similar challenge to making sense of contract and generation data for policy compliance and reporting. 

This project reflects my passion for using technology as a dual force for environmental and economic impact - turning complex energy decisions into clear, actionable steps for a sustainable future. It follows my work on the OFGEM MHHR initiative. The MHHR is a  transformative energy sector initiative modernising the UK’s electricity settlement system to half-hourly intervals, enabling accurate billing, grid flexibility, and smarter energy use. It paves the way for renewable integration and cost savings for consumers. 

SPYDER is a Net Zero initiative Price comparison platform. it is  designed to helps you find the best electricity tariff at the most competitive price. Compare different tariffs, check prices and choose the right option to save on energy bills. The Reader also serves as a forecasting system, a settlement tool and a Net Zero initiative - empowering businesses and consumers with actionable insights for reducing carbon emissions and adopting sustainable energy solutions.  

Hosted on EnergyTariffsCheck.com - https://www.energytariffscheck.com/ , **SPYDER** is a digital representation of a physical energy meter reader utilising real-time energy data, AI-driven analytics, and user-friendly tools to compare tariffs, track consumption,  simulate scenarios, predict outcomes, enable forecasting, facilitate predictive maintenance, and recommend cost-effective renewable energy options. 
  
We have integrated dynamic carbon footprint tracking, personalised energy-saving strategies, and compliance frameworks into a scalable Next.js, TypeScript and Python platform - helping users align sustainability goals with practical, measurable actions.    

This  Digital Twin Energy Meter Reader is a dynamic, virtual representation of a physical Energy Meter Reader. It mirrors the real-world entity by continuously collecting data from sensors, real-time data streams, data lakes, IoT devices, and other sources. The data is then processed and analyzed to create a digital replica that accurately reflects the behavior, status, and condition of its physical counterpart. By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics, digital twins can simulate various scenarios and predict future outcomes. This enables stakeholders to monitor performance, diagnose issues, optimize processes, and make data-driven decisions in real-time.




### The Nut Cracker  (V4 - Python)

The primary objective of **Nut Cracker** (Digital Twin V4) is to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), to streamline the transaction process involving data generation, processing,and transformation - ETL. This process focuses on real-time data sourced from distributed and disparate networks and systems. It's ML lifecycle covers data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring.

- Key functionalities include:

1. Predictive Analysis: Utilizing AI to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies such as spikes, valleys, and boundaries, enabling predictive maintenance and detecting outliers or tampered data.

2. Visualization and Reporting: Generating comprehensive visualization reports, graphs, and documentation to review real-time system performance. These tools aid in forecasting and enhancing productivity by providing actionable insights, real-time monitoring, optimisation, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing decision-making.

Nut Cracker aims to integrate AI and ML  technologies to optimize data workflows, deliver predictive insights, and provide robust visualization tools for performance monitoring and future planning. As a high-volume throughput system, it exemplifies real-time asynchronous data processing capability ensuring scalability, reliability, flexibility, observability, security and addresses challenges like schema evolution and fault tolerance.

NodeJS, JavaScript,  Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Inrtelligence, Event Driven Concurrency, RDBMS / NoSQL technologies (e.g. MySQL, Redis, DynamoDB), and cloud technologies are core in this innovation.

## Key Features LLM Integration

✅ Predictive Maintenance: LLM analyses trends to flag anomalies (e.g., meter failures).

✅ Natural Language Queries (Semantic SEARCH): Users ask, "Show worst-performing meters this week" via chat.

✅ Automated Reports: LangChain generates summaries from Supabase data.

✅ Simulation Scenarios: "What if meter load increases by 20%?" → LLM runs digital twin simulations.
