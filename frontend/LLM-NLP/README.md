# README

- Key Features Added

## A

✅ Predictive Maintenance: LLM analyzes trends to flag anomalies (e.g., meter failures).

✅ Natural Language Queries (Semantic SEARCH): Users ask, "Show worst-performing meters this week" via chat.

✅ Automated Reports: LangChain generates summaries from Supabase data.

✅ Simulation Scenarios: "What if meter load increases by 20%?" → LLM runs digital twin simulations.


## B

✅ Type Safety - Zod for runtime validation

✅ Semantic Search - PGVector embeddings

✅ Error Handling - Structured logging

✅ Cost Control - GPT-4-turbo with context window optimization

Production Checklist:

Set rate limiting on /llm/query endpoint

Enable Supabase RLS for llm_queries table

Monitor usage via Supabase Logs Explorer

## Key Features Added:

Natural Language Query Input: A textarea form field after the STOP button where users can type queries like:

"Show worst-performing meters this week"

"Which meters have high consumption?"

"Show me expensive meters"

"What's the status of all meters?"

Query Processing: The processNaturalLanguageQuery function analyzes the user's query and returns relevant meter data based on:

Time-based queries (weekly data)

Performance queries (worst/best performing)

Cost queries (expensive meters)

General status queries

Results Modal: A modal that displays the query results in an organized format with:

Meter identification

Performance metrics

Consumption rates

Cost information

Supplier details

Enhanced UI: Clean, user-friendly interface with proper styling that matches the existing design

Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

Users can now ask natural language questions about their meter data and get instant analysis, making the application much more interactive and user-friendly, similar to energytariffscheck.com.
